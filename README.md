<p align="justify">Multispectral imaging enables the acquisition of extensive datasets that require advanced analytical processing. 
Pix4Dfields software allows the computation of vegetation indices for user-defined areas, along with their 
corresponding standard deviations, which are essential for further analyses. Nevertheless, although this process 
condenses raw imagery into interpretable metrics, it produces a substantial volume of results whose proper 
interpretation is critical, especially in long-term studies.</p>

<p align="justify">When analysing vegetation indices derived from Pix4Dfields across different time points, one possible approach 
involves their preliminary processing and, if necessary, the application of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This step may be 
particularly useful when the results originate from different measurement and analysis methodologies, such as varying ground 
sampling distances (GSD) or annotation strategies, in order to identify the most stable outputs for subsequent interpretation. 
However, this procedure is not strictly required in all cases.</p>

<p align="justify">The schematic above illustrates the complete pipeline for the preliminary processing of the obtained results. 
  The workflow begins with the panel-based export of results for multiple layers derived from vegetation indices in Pix4Dfields, 
  together with the corresponding folder structure generated by the software. Consequently, the results of a single measurement 
  consist of vegetation index values calculated for all annotations present within the study area, saved as separate .csv files.</p>

<p align="justify">In the next step, these files are merged into a single .csv file using the DataMerge_FirstStep.py script when 
  the analysis is limited to a single measurement. Alternatively, the same script is applied independently to .csv files from 
  multiple measurement folders when the objective is to perform a temporal analysis.</p>

<p align="justify">The resulting .csv files from individual measurements are then merged into one comprehensive dataset. 
  Although this procedure could be implemented using a single script, the workflow was deliberately divided into two scripts 
  to provide greater flexibility. The DataMerge_SecondStep.py script performs the final merge and enables the inclusion of data, 
  such as the measurement identifier and flight altitude, in the output .csv file, which substantially facilitates subsequent analyses.</p>

<p align="justify">In addition, the DataCorrectness_Test.py script is used to verify the integrity of the final merged dataset with
  respect to potential missing values, while the Sorting_Results.py script allows the results to be organized into a more logical and 
  structured format.</p>
