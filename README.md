<p align="justify">Multispectral imaging enables the acquisition of extensive datasets that require advanced analytical processing. 
Pix4Dfields software allows the computation of vegetation indices for user-defined areas, along with their 
corresponding standard deviations, which are essential for further analyses. Nevertheless, although this process 
condenses raw imagery into interpretable metrics, it produces a substantial volume of results whose proper 
interpretation is critical, especially in long-term studies.</p>
